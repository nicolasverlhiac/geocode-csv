# Geocode CSV using Google Maps API

This repository provides a geocoding solution for CSV files containing contact addresses using the Google Maps API. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), enabling businesses and data analysts to leverage location-based information in their applications and analyses.
It includes a Docker image that utilizes the Google Maps library and Pandas to add latitude and longitude information to contact files. 

## Features

- Geocodes CSV files with contact addresses using the Google Maps API
- Retrieves latitude and longitude information for each address
- Adds latitude and longitude to a new column in the CSV file
- Useful for businesses and data analysts working with address data

## How to use this image

You can use the geocoding solution by directly pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub or by building the image from the source code. 

_**Note:** Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your system before executing the docker command._

### Using Docker Hub:

1. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull nicolasverlhiac/geocode-csv
```
2. Set up your Google Maps API key:

	* Retrieve your Google Maps API keys from the Google Cloud Console.
	* Replace your_key with your actual Google Maps API key in the docker command.
3. Create a `data` directory and place your input CSV file in the `data` directory.

	* **You need to name the CSV file `input.csv`.**
    * You can use the provided `sample-input.csv` file as a base by duplicating it and renaming the duplicate to `input.csv`. This file already has the required CSV structure and serves as a template for your own data.
4. Execute the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/csv" -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key nicolasverlhiac/geocode-csv
```
5. After the execution completes, you will find the geocoded CSV `ouput.csv` file with latitude and longitude information in the csv directory.

### Build image

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t nicolasverlhiac/geocode-csv .
```

This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory. The -t flag allows you to specify a tag or name for the image. In this example, the image is tagged as nicolasverlhiac/geocode-csv.

2. Once the image is built, you can use it in the same way as described in the "Using Docker Hub" section. **Follow steps 2 to 5** mentioned in the "[Using Docker Hub](#using-docker-hub)" section to geocode your CSV file.

By building the image locally, you have more control over the image and can make modifications if needed. Additionally, building the image locally ensures that you have the latest version of the code and dependencies.

### Required CSV fields (`input.csv` CSV example)

Example of a CSV file to be placed in the `data/input.csv` folder before executing the Docker command.

You can use the provided `sample-input.csv` file located in `/data` as a base by duplicating it and renaming the duplicate to `input.csv`. This file already has the required CSV structure and serves as a template for your own data.
